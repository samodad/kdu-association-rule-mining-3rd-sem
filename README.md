# KDU Association Rule Mining – 3rd Semester

This repository contains practical work and projects related to **Association Rule Mining (ARM)** for the **3rd Semester at KDU**.

## 📌 About
Association Rule Mining is a data mining technique used to discover relationships between items in large datasets (e.g., market basket analysis).

Example rule:
{Bread, Milk} → {Butter}

Key measures:
- **Support** – How often items appear together
- **Confidence** – How often the rule is correct
- **Lift** – Strength of the relationship between items

## 📂 Contents
- Datasets used for ARM
- Implementation code (Python/R)
- Experiment notebooks
- Generated rules and results

## 🛠 Tools
- Python / R  
- Apriori Algorithm  
- Data mining libraries (e.g., mlxtend, arules)

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand association rules
- Apply Apriori algorithm
- Interpret support, confidence, and lift
